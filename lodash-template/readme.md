Conbo.js Todo Application Example
=================================

Simple Todo application example using Conbo.js framework and Lo-Dash/Underscore templating, based on Addy Osmani's Backbone demo at TodoMVC.com

Most of the templating functionality can be replaced using Conbo.js's automatic data binding features, so we'll create another demo to show you how that works later on.
