ConboJS Todo Application Example (ES5 syntax)
=============================================

Simple Todo application example using the ConboJS framework showing how Conbo's binding features can be used to automatically bind View and Model properties to DOM elements.

This example is based on the TodoMVC.com template to enable easy comparison with other MVC frameworks, although it should be viewed at rapid prototypes rather than an example of best-practice.
