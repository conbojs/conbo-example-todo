Conbo.js Todo Application Example
=================================

Simple Todo application examples using the Conbo.js framework, based on the TodoMVC.com template to enable easy comparison with other MVC frameworks (although while they're good example of Conbo.js capabilities, they should be viewed at rapid prototypes rather than examples of best-practice).

Examples
--------

* **lodash-templates** demonstrates the use of Conbo.js in combination with the Lo-Dash/Underscore templating system
* **cb-bind** (coming soon) will demonstrate the same application using Conbo.js's built-in data binding, which is the way we'd generally recommend doing things
